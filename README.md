## API Documentation
API docs can be found in the projects [Wiki](https://github.com/Tornadosky/recipes-management/wiki/API-documentation).

## Getting Started with the development

You should have Java version >= 17.
First you need to clone the repository. Then add _.env_ file to _resources_ with db credentials.

## Contributing to the repo

Every time you want to add something new or fix and issue, make sure you follow the steps below:

1. Create new branch from `main` branch by running ```git checkout -b <issue-name>```. This will create a new branch with the `issue-name` and get you to the same branch.

2. Make the necessary changes on your branch and when done, create a `pull request`

NOTE: Also, you may want to update your local(issue) branch from main, to achieve that you need to switch back to the main branch by running `git checkout main`, then you need to pull all the new changes from remote by running `git pull origin main` on your terminal. The next step is to switch back to your issue branch and running `git merge master`. This will update your your issue branch.
